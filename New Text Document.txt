4️⃣ Backend Architecture (Services / Modules)

In Antigravity you can keep this as a single codebase with feature modules.

4.1 Auth Service

Sign up / login / refresh token

Social auth via Google OAuth

Permissions: free vs premium

Endpoints:

POST /auth/signup

POST /auth/login

POST /auth/google

POST /auth/refresh

POST /auth/logout

4.2 User & Profile Service

Stores:

Basic info: name, email, country

Professional info: experience, domain, desired role

Skills: extracted + self-declared

Constraints: hours/week, deadline (e.g., “6 months”)

Endpoints:

GET /me

PUT /me

GET /me/profile

PUT /me/profile

4.3 Resume Parsing Service

Flow:

User uploads file → frontend sends to backend

Backend:

Extracts raw text (Python: pypdf, python-docx, etc.)

Sends text to Gemini with a structured extraction prompt

Gemini returns JSON: {summary, skills, experience, projects, education}

We store in DB and merge with existing profile.

Endpoints:

POST /resume/upload

GET /resume/parsed

4.4 Roadmap Generator Service

This is the core AI brain.

Inputs:

User profile

Skills (current vs target)

Goal role (e.g. “ML Engineer”)

Time horizon, hours/week

LLM Prompt yields:

Stages: Beginner → Intermediate → Advanced

For each stage:

Skills to learn

Suggested resources (can be IDs that we map)

Project ideas

Estimated time

Priority

We store in DB as:

roadmaps table:

id, user_id, goal_role, created_at, status

roadmap_sections table:

id, roadmap_id, title, order

roadmap_milestones:

id, section_id, title, description, order

roadmap_tasks:

id, milestone_id, title, type (course, video, project, reading), resource_id, estimated_hours, order

Endpoints:

POST /roadmap/generate (calls Gemini)

GET /roadmap/current

GET /roadmap/:id

4.5 Progress Tracking Service

User actions:

Mark task complete / in-progress

Add notes

Track time spent

Tables:

task_progress: user_id, task_id, status, time_spent

roadmap_progress: computed from tasks

Endpoints:

POST /tasks/:taskId/progress

GET /roadmap/:id/progress

GET /stats/overview

4.6 Resource Recommender & Knowledge Base

Maintain a curated resources table:

id, title, url, type (course, video, article, book), tags, cost, rating

(Optional) Build vector embeddings over resource titles/descriptions for semantic matching with skills/goals.

For a skill gap like “System Design”, query similar resources and attach.

Endpoints:

GET /resources?skill=python&difficulty=beginner

POST /roadmap/:id/regenerate-section (to swap better resources)

4.7 AI Coach Chat Service

Chat history stored per user

When user sends a message:

Backend bundles: profile, current roadmap, recent progress

Sends structured prompt to Gemini as a “coach”

Endpoints:

POST /chat

GET /chat/history

4.8 Billing / Subscription

Integrate Stripe / Razorpay

Plans:

Free: 1 roadmap, limited chat per month

Pro: unlimited roadmaps, advanced analytics, priority AI

Webhook endpoint to handle payment confirmation.

Endpoints:

GET /billing/plans

POST /billing/checkout

POST /billing/webhook (Stripe/Razorpay)

6️⃣ AI Integration (Gemini)

You’ll likely have 3–4 system prompts:

Resume Extractor

Input: raw text

Output: JSON {skills, experience, education, projects}

Roadmap Generator

Input: profile + current skills + goal + time

Output: structured roadmap (we parse & store)

Resource Mapper

Input: skill gaps + resource catalog sample

Output: ranking of which resources to attach where

Coach Chat

Input: user question + context (roadmap, progress)

Output: conversational but structured coaching

7️⃣ How This Fits into Antigravity Workflow

Assuming Antigravity gives you:

Cloud IDE

App hosting (frontend + backend)

Built-in Gemini access

DB integration

Your flow:

Create project: monorepo with frontend/ + backend/.

Backend in TypeScript / Python:

Define REST APIs as above.

Plug in Gemini SDK provided by Antigravity.

Use its DB connector to Postgres.

Frontend:

Next.js app in frontend/

Connect to backend via Antigravity’s base URL.

Environment variables:

GEMINI_API_KEY, STRIPE_SECRET, DB creds etc.

Deploy:

Antigravity handles hosting, scaling, SSL.

Configure routes so /api/* goes to backend, others to frontend.
